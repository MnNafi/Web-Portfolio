            <h3>Become World's No:1 Web Developer</h3>
            <p>We should reach the highest level of what we start. Nothing on earth is straightforward, but not impossible. And if someone can't dream of being big or the best, then he will never be able to move forward. I may not have reached the best stage yet. But oneday, I will definitely go. Life is what you want it to be. So, I am dreaming to be the No:1</p>

            <p>We always have to improve ourselves. Nothing ever ends. I also did not stop learning. I benefit a lot from the lessons learned from Programming Hero. And I continue to expand the scope of my own knowledge. This is how I became a professional web developer. I have worked on a few projects, I will do more if I get the chance. In this way I will continue to enhance my experience.</p>

            <p>My dream for a long time was to be a web developer. Programming Hero gives me the opportunity to fulfill that dream. They teach me hand-to-hand web developing. They teach me HTML first, from CSS, Javascript, PSP etc. While learning there, I created several websites. Which further boosts my morale. Then with their help I work on a lot of small projects. And that's how I became a web developer.</p>
